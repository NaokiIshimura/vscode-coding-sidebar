## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Cmd+Shift+A` (macOS)<br>`Ctrl+Shift+A` (Windows/Linux) | Focus AI Coding Panel |
| `Cmd+S` (macOS)<br>`Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) | New Task (when panel is focused) |
| `Cmd+M` (macOS)<br>`Ctrl+M` (Windows/Linux) | Create new Markdown file (when panel is focused) |
| `Cmd+R` (macOS)<br>`Ctrl+R` (Windows/Linux) | Run task in Editor (auto-saves and sends command to terminal) |

### Basic actions
1. Click the "AI Coding Panel" icon in the activity bar (or press `Cmd+Shift+A` / `Ctrl+Shift+A`).
2. Use Tasks to create the folder you use for AI coding.
3. Create Markdown files from the Tasks view.
4. Click a timestamp-named Markdown file (e.g., `2025_1229_1430_25_PROMPT.md`) in Tasks to edit it in the Editor view below. Other Markdown files open in the standard editor.
5. Write instructions for the AI in the Editor and save with the Save button.
6. Right-click the Markdown file in Tasks and choose "Copy Relative Path," then share it with your AI tool.

## Template Feature

When you create a file from Tasks, you can automatically populate it with a template. This keeps Markdown files used for AI coding consistent and saves time.

### Configure the template
1. Click the gear icon in the Tasks pane.
2. Choose "Workspace Settings" -> "Customize template."
3. Template files are created in `.vscode/ai-coding-panel/templates/`:
   - `task.md` - Template for Start Task
   - `spec.md` - Template for New Spec
   - `prompt.md` - Template for New File (PROMPT.md)
4. Edit the templates and save them.

### Default template
The first template contains the following:

```markdown
file: {{filename}}
created: {{datetime}}

---

# task

```

### Available variables
Use the following variables inside a template:

- `{{datetime}}`: Creation date and time (for example, 2025/11/3 12:27:13)
- `{{filename}}`: Filename including extension (for example, 2025_1229_1430_25_PROMPT.md)
- `{{timestamp}}`: Timestamp (for example, 2025_1229_1430_25)
- `{{filepath}}`: File path relative to workspace root (for example, .claude/tasks/2025_1229_1430_25_PROMPT.md)
- `{{dirpath}}`: Directory path relative to workspace root (for example, .claude/tasks)

### Template priority
1. Workspace templates in `.vscode/ai-coding-panel/templates/` (if present)
2. Built-in extension templates

### Template examples
- Capture prompts for AI assistants in the `overview` section.
- Track to-dos in the `tasks` section.
- Add project-specific sections.

## File Operations

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Create files or folders | Quickly scaffold new files and folders. |
| Rename | Rename files and folders. After renaming a directory, automatically navigates to the renamed directory. |
| Delete | Delete files and folders (moved to trash). |
| Copy / Cut / Paste | Perform standard clipboard operations. |
| Drag & Drop | Copy files by dragging them within the Tasks view or from external sources. Displays a success message after copying. |
| Archive | Archive task directories to keep your workspace organized. Click the archive icon (inline button) on a directory row, or right-click and select "Archive" to move it to the `archived` folder. When inside a non-root directory, an archive button also appears in the path display header - clicking it archives the current directory and returns to root. If a directory with the same name already exists, a timestamp is automatically added to avoid conflicts. |
| Checkout Branch | Right-click a directory to checkout a git branch using the directory name. Creates the branch if it doesn't exist, or switches to it if it already exists. |
| Insert Path to Editor | Insert relative path into the Editor view. Click the edit icon on file rows, or right-click and select "Insert Path to Editor". Supports multiple selection. |
| Insert Path to Terminal | Insert relative path into the Terminal view. Click the terminal icon on file rows, or right-click and select "Insert Path to Terminal". Supports multiple selection. Paths are separated by spaces. |
